## Importance of Open Source in 3D Printing

The 3D printing community has thrived on the principles of open source software and hardware through rep-rap. By freely sharing knowledge, designs, and tools, makers have been able to rapidly advance the state of the art and overcome technical challenges together.

Open source 3D printing software, firmware, and CAD models have lowered the barriers to entry, enabled collaboration, and inspired countless new projects and innovations. Panda Swap is proud to contribute to this thriving open ecosystem and continue the tradition of sharing and collaboration.
## Automated Bed Clearing and Printing
Our web application provides an easy-to-use interface for automating the bed clearing and printing process for Marlin and Bambu Lab 3D printers. By leveraging the power of open-source printer firmware, our tool allows users to:

- Automatically clear the print bed after a job completes
- Remotely initiate new print jobs from a web browser
- Monitor printer status and progress in real-time
- Manage print queues and schedules

This application is designed to save time, reduce manual effort, and help 3D printing enthusiasts be more productive. We believe tools like this will drive wider adoption of 3D printing in homes, schools, workshops, and production.
